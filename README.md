# Brain Tumor Detection

This project focuses on the early detection of brain tumors using deep learning techniques. 
It utilizes transfer learning with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) as the foundation for tumor classification. 
The model is trained on a dataset of MRI scan images, with data augmentation to enhance performance. 
It aims to provide an accurate and automated tool for brain tumor detection from MRI scans, contributing to timely medical intervention.
